Doom 3 BFG VR GPL Source Code

GENERAL NOTES

GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data and patching:
-----------------------

This source release does not contain any game data, the game data is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual.

You should patch the game to the latest version (although it will still work on the first version).

Note that Doom 3 BFG Edition is available from the Steam store at
http://store.steampowered.com/app/208200/


Compiling on win32:
-------------------

A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 is provided in neo\doom3.sln
We expect the solution file is compatible with the Express releases

You will need the Microsoft DirectX SDK installed as well.
If it does not reside in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010)"
you will need to update the project files accordingly.


Steam:
------
The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code release does not include functionality for integrating with 
Steam.  This includes roaming profiles, achievements, leaderboards, matchmaking, the overlay, or
any other Steam features.


Bink:
-----

Bink support NOW IS INCLUDED, by using FFMPEG. That means you need the FFMPEG DLLs to run it.
Download the "shared" package from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ and extract the dlls
into your Doom 3 BFG executable directory. If running from Visual Studio, put them in:
build\win32\debug\ or build\win32\release or build\win32\retail
If you find the newest version doesn't work, download this version:
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/shared/ffmpeg-20140330-git-c01ddf8-win32-shared.7z

The original Doom 3 RoQ cinematic files are also now supported. If present, they will be used
instead of the bink files. 


Back End Rendering of Stencil Shadows:
--------------------------------------

"Carmack's Reverse" depth fail method NOW IS INCLUDED. 


Other platforms, updated source code, security issues:
------------------------------------------------------

If you have obtained this source code several weeks after the time of release,
it is likely that you can find modified and improved versions of the engine in
various open source projects across the internet.

Depending what is your interest with the source code, those may be a better starting point.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
